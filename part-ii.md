## 1. Final Project - Part II
### Summary
This project focuses on the issue of language extinction and what people can do to save endangered languages. It is estimated that there are around 7,000 languages in the world, but over 50% of them are likely to be extinct by the year 2100. Dominant languages like English are accelerating this process as more people are shifting to speak popular languages more often. I want to take a deeper look into this urgent matter and raise people's awareness to protect languages starting from everyday practices.

Note: I have switched the topic from part I of the project as there were not many good data sources available for my previous topic. The overall structure of the project remains unchanged.


### Structure
- Setup: A look at the language situation around the world. How many languages are there? What are the popular languages? How many people are speaking each language?
  - The number of languages in the world
  - Top languages by population
  - Top languages by countries
  - The impact and importance of languages in shaping our societies
- Conflict: Many languages are facing a serious problem of extinction.
  - Percentages of endangered languages among all languages
  - Map of endangered languages in the world
  - Number of endangered languages
  - Speed of language extinction
- Resolution: Actions people can do to help protect endangered languages.
  - Trend of research work on language protection
  - Number of language learning resources
  - Actions to help preserve languages in our daily lives

## 2. Wireframes and Storyboards

### Storyboard on Shorthand

[Save our languages](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/save-our-languages/index.html)

I made the storyboard of my project on Shorthand for user research. At this stage, I planned to focus on the overall flow of the topic Iâ€™m discussing. Several data visualization charts were included to gather feedback on whether they are conveying information properly. The descriptive texts are mostly titles or placeholders which will be replaced in the final version.


## 3. User Research Protocol

### Target Audience

With this project, I intend to motivate the general public to pay more attention to language preservation. Everyone should be inspired to learn various languages bit by bit in their daily lives. More specifically, my target audience is people who are interested in learning new languages and immigrants in the United States who do not speak English as their native language. Another target audience of this project could also be language learning organizations such as Duolingo. They could use this information to decide what endangered languages they should provide to attract more users.

### Approach

In order to find representative individuals to interview, I decided to narrow it down to my friends and classmates at CMU and start from these student groups. I focused specifically on international students who come from a non-English-speaking society. In addition, I also reached out to a few Duolingo users because they are likely to be interested in learning new languages. My goal in interviewing these target audiences is to see if the storyboard has a smooth flow and is effective in motiving people to learn more about endangered languages.
- After reading the storyboard, could you tell me what it is about?
- Does anything seem confusing to you?
- Which part do you find most inspiring?
- Can you understand the meaning of each data visualization quickly and easily?
- Is there anything you think is missing?
- Are you motivated by the story to learn some endangered languages?
- What else do you think could be adjusted or improved?

### Interviews

**International student from India, early 20s**

After reading the storyboard, could you tell me what it is about?

> Protecting endangered languages I believe.

Does anything seem confusing to you?

> Overall I think everything is quite clear. The story flows smoothly and logically.

Which part do you find most inspiring?

> I think the contrast between the number of people who speak the top 12 languages and the rest is very effective.

Can you understand the meaning of each data visualization quickly and easily?

> Yes, the visualizations are clear. However, the map of endangered languages in each country is a bit hard to navigate. It probably has something to do with the limitation of Tableau.

Is there anything you think is missing?

> I understand this is just a draft, but adding more text to the storyboard would definitely help people understand what you will be discussing.

Are you motivated by the story to learn some endangered languages?

> I think so. I understand the importance of my own language and 

What else do you think could be adjusted or improved?

> Maybe you could talk more about the consequence of losing so many different languages at a rapid speed.



<br/><br/>
**International student from China, early 20s**

After reading the storyboard, could you tell me what it is about?

> The situation of language extinction in the world and how to protect those endangered languages.

Does anything seem confusing to you?

> The chart which says over 50% of the world population is speaking those 12 top languages. I think the colors could be switched since you are focusing on the section of other languages.

Which part do you find most inspiring?

> The map of the endangered languages is pretty alarming.

Can you understand the meaning of each data visualization quickly and easily?

> Yes, I liked the visualizations presented here.

Is there anything you think is missing?

> I want to see more detailed and practical actions. 

Are you motivated by the story to learn some endangered languages?

> Yes, it has convinced me that language extinction is a serious issue.

What else do you think could be adjusted or improved?

> The layout could be better. Instead of putting a chart in the entire section, maybe you could add some explanatory text on the left or right side of the chart.


<br/><br/>
**Duolingo user, software engineer**

After reading the storyboard, could you tell me what it is about?

> Protecting endangered languages.

Does anything seem confusing to you?

> I'm wondering what might cause the languages to get into the state of endangerment.

Which part do you find most inspiring?

> Almost half of the languages are endangered, so it is urgent for us to protect them.

Can you understand the meaning of each data visualization quickly and easily?

> Yes, I think the charts are pretty good. The use of colors can be more consistent.

Is there anything you think is missing?

> Actions to save the languages is an important section. I also think you can provide some existing language learning resources like Duolingo.

Are you motivated by the story to learn some endangered languages?

> Yes, I enjoy learning new languages.

What else do you think could be adjusted or improved?

> As I mentioned before, maybe you could provide some information on the existing resources of language learning and how effective those resources are in terms of language protection.
