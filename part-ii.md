## 1. Outline
### Summary
This project focuses on the issue of language extinction and what people can do to save endangered languages. It is estimated that there are around 7,000 languages in the world, but over 50% of them are likely to be extinct by the year 2100. Dominant languages like English are accelerating this process as more people are shifting to speak popular languages more often. I want to take a deeper look into this urgent matter and raise people's awareness to protect languages starting from everyday practices.

Note: I have switched the topic from part I of the project as there were not many good data sources available for my previous topic. The overall structure of the project remains unchanged.


### Structure
- Setup: A look at the language situation around the world. How many languages are there? What are the popular lanaguges? How many people are speaking each language?
  - The number of languages in the world
  - Top languages by population
  - Top languages by countries
  - Percentages of endangered languages among all languages
- Conflict: Many languages are facing a serious problem of extiction.
- Resolution: Actions people can do to help protect endangered languages.

## 2. Wireframes and Storyboards

### Storyboard on Shorthand

[Save our languages](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/save-our-languages/index.html)

I made the storyboard of my project on Shorthand for user research. At this stage, I planned to focus on the overall flow of the topic Iâ€™m discussing. Several data visualization charts were included to gather feedback on whether they are conveying information properly. The descriptive texts are mostly titles or placeholders which will be replaced in the final version.


## 3. User Research Protocol

### Target Audience

With this project, I intend to motivate the general public to pay more attention to language preservation. Everyone should be inspired to learn various languages bit by bit in their daily lives. More specifically, my target audience is people who are interested in learning new languages and immigrants in the United States who do not speak English as their native language. Another target audience of this project could also be language learning organizations such as Duolingo. They could use this information to decide what endangered languages they should provide to attract more users.

### Approach

In order to find representative individuals to interview, I decided to narrow it down to my friends and classmates at CMU and start from these student groups. I focused specifically on international students who come from a non-English-speaking society. In addition, I also reached out to a few Duolingo users because they are likely to be interested in learning new languages. My goal in interviewing these target audiences is to see if the storyboard has a smooth flow and is effective in motiving people to learn more about endangered languages.
- After reading the storyboard, could you tell me what it is about?
- Does anything seem confusing to you?
- Which part do you find most inspiring?
- Can you understand the meaning of each data visualization quickly and easily?
- Is there anything you think is missing?
- Are you motived by the story to learn some endangered languages?
- What else do you think could be adjusted or improved?
