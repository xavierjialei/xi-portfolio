## 1. Outline
### Summary
This project focuses on the issue of language extinction and what people can do to save endangered languages. It is estimated that there are around 7,000 languages in the world, but over 50% of them are likely to be extinct by the year 2100. Dominant languages like English are accelerating this process as more people are shifting to speak popular languages more often. I want to take a deeper look into this urgent matter and raise people's awareness to protect languages starting from everyday practices.

Note: I have switched the topic from part I of the project as there were not many good data sources available for my previous topic. The overall structure of the project remains unchanged.


### Structure
- Setup: A look at the language situation around the world. How many languages are there? What are the popular lanaguges? How many people are speaking each language?
  - The number of languages in the world
  - Top languages by population
  - Top languages by countries
  - Percentages of endangered languages among all languages
- Conflict: Many languages 
- Resolution:  

## 2. Wireframes and Storyboards

I made the storyboard of my project on Shorthand for user research. At this stage, I planned to focus on the overall flow of the topic Iâ€™m discussing. Several data visualization charts were included to gather feedback on whether they are conveying information properly. The descriptive texts are mostly titles or placeholders which will be replaced in the final version.


## 3. User Research Protocol
- Target audience: The general public who care about language protection and immigrants in the United States who don't speak English as their native language.
- Approach to identifying representative individuals: Reaching out to international students at CMU 
- Interview script
