# Final Project - 

## 1. Outline
### Summary
My final project will focus on the domestic violence issue in the disabilities community. People with disabilities are at a higher risk of abuse and violence in a relationship compared to people without disabilities. In addition, it is often more difficult for them to seek help or escape from a toxic envrionment. I want to take a deep dive into the current situation, trend, and reason behind this issue, and raise people's awareness to take action to protect people with the disabilities and prevent domestic violence in general.
