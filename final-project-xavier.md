# Final Project

## 1. Outline
### Summary
My final project will focus on the domestic violence issue in the disabilities community. People with disabilities are at a higher risk of abuse and violence in a relationship compared to people without disabilities. In addition, it is often more difficult for them to seek help or escape from a toxic environment. I want to take a deep dive into the current situation, trend, and reason behind this issue, and raise people's awareness to take action to protect people with disabilities and prevent domestic violence in general.

### Structure
- Setup: The number of people with disabilities who suffer from domestic violence in the US is rising over the years. Factors including the background of pandemic, gender, race, and social status should also be taken into consideration.
  - The porportion of people with disabilities in the entire society
  - Number of people suffering from domestic violence and its trend over the years
- Conflict: Domestic violence causes significant trauma for the victims. The trauma and consequences are especially serious for people with disabilities. They also face specific difficulties when seeking help.
  - Serious issues that people with disabilities are facing
  - Number and percentage of people with disabilities who report that they experience difficulties in seeking help
  - Consequences of domestic violence in the disability community
  - Gap between what people with disabilities are looking for and what resources are currently provided
- Resolution: Actions to be taken by people with disabilities themselves and people around them that could help protect, prevent, and reduce the negative impact of domestic violence are recommended.
  - Effective resources that can help people with disabilities
  - What people with disabilities can do to help themselves in their daily lives
  - What friends and families of people with disabilities can do to make sure they are not suffering from domestic violence
  - What the society in general can do to set up a system to prevent and reduce the occurence of domestic violence

After the critique in class, I have received the following feedback and will implement changes in the next assignment:
- **Pick a more narrowed focus.** Does the story focus on the issue in the United States or the whole world? Does it look at people with disabilities living in cities or rural areas? I will select a clear focus based on the data I can find.
- **More practical call-to-actions.** I should provide more specific and helpful call-to-actions. In my draft, the actions seem to focus mainly on what people with disabilities can do to protect themselves. How should other people who are not familiar with disability or domestic violence join to create a better society?
- **Highlight the gap.** The gap between what the people with disabilities want and what current resources are available should be highlighted to further emphasize the urgency and importance of the issue. It also leads to the resolution part smoothly.



## 3. The Data

- [Disability Statistics - United States - 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelacorley/disability-statistics-united-states-2018)

I intend to use this data to present the fact that disability is a common issue in the world and we should pay more attention to the health of this group. 

- [People with Disabilities and Domestic Violence](https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2497/people_with_disabilities.pdf)
- [Sexual Violence and Intimate Partner Violence Among People with Disabilities](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/sexualviolence/svandipv.html#:~:text=Disability%20affects%20more%20than%201,to%20people%20without%20a%20disability.)
- [Crime Against Persons with Disabilities, 2009â€“2019](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/capd0919st.pdf)

There are reports I found related to the issue of domestic violence and people with disabilities. They contain certain useful data and I will need to visualize them. 



## 4. Method and Medium

For the final project, I plan to complete it on Shorthand. It is my first time to use Shorthand, but I believe I'm able to learn how to build a website using Shorthand quickly.
