# Final Project - 

## 1. Outline
### Summary
My final project will focus on the domestic violence issue in the disabilities community. People with disabilities are at a higher risk of abuse and violence in a relationship compared to people without disabilities. In addition, it is often more difficult for them to seek help or escape from a toxic environment. I want to take a deep dive into the current situation, trend, and reason behind this issue, and raise people's awareness to take action to protect people with disabilities and prevent domestic violence in general.

### Structure
- Setup: The number of people with disabilities who suffer from domestic violence is rising over the years. Take into consideration the background of pandemic, gender, race, and social status. People with disabilities also face specific difficulties when seeking help.
- Conflict: Domestic violence causes significant trauma for the victims. The trauma and consequences are especially serious for people with disabilities. 
- Resolution: Actions to be taken by people with disabilities themselves and people around them that could help protect, prevent, and reduce the negative impact of domestic violence are recommended.
