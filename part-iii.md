## Part III: The Final Deliverable

### Deliverable

I used Shorthand to build my story. Data visualizations are made using tools like Figma, Flourish, and Tableau and integrated into the story. The data comes from open data source libraries including Kaggle and reports/articles where I converted the data into csv files and uploaded them to the data visualization tools. Some data files are uploaded to the GitHub page directly, and all sources are listed in the "references" section of the story on the Shorthand website.

### Audience

One of the target audiences of my story is language enthusiasts who like to learn new languages. When they are selecting the next language to learn in the future, I want to encourage them to pick an endangered one to help preserve the knowledge of that language. Another audience group of this project is speakers of non-mainstream languages. If they realize the urgency and importance of language protection, they can be motivated to promote their own languages with pride. Another potential audience is people working in the business of language education such as Duolingo. When these companies are researching for which languages to offer on their platforms, I hope they can make effort to select some endangered languages. Last but not least, I also want this story to be appealing and inspiring for the general public. I have included some background information about languages such as the most spoken languages in the world and the definition of language extinction so that the context is easier to understand in case the general readers are not familiar with it.


### Changes from Part II

- **Added an example of endangered language**: After completing part II of this final project, I was suggested that I should add some examples of endangered languages to be more specific and make people feel more empathetic. Providing a general overview of the problem is not nearly as effective as telling the story of one particular endangered language. Therefore, I introduced the predicament that the Irish language is now facing.
- **Added the causes of language domination and endangerment**: In the previous version, I did not mention the causes of language endangerment, which felt like missing a piece of the puzzle. Language lovers and researchers may be familiar with the causes, but the general public probably doesn't. Since I want this story to be approachable to the public, I'm also including the explanation of causes to provide a more comprehensive understanding.
- **Call-to-actions are more specific and detailed**: The recommended actions are improved to be more specific with example resources provided. For instance, I presented the usage statistics of Duolingo and some of the endangered languages offered in the app. I also provided the links to some renowned language protection research projects.
- **Headers of the charts are clearer and easier to understand**: Some interviewees found that the headers of some of my visualizations in the story were a bit confusing. For example, the bar chart about official languages and countries was originally titled "countries and their official languages", which seemed to be indicating the number of official languages for each country. So I changed the header to "10 languages that are most officially adopted", which is more accurate based on the follow-ups with interviewees.
- **Use colors and bold style in text sections to highlight important information**: In the previous iterations, I only used colors in those data visualizations. But one of the interviewees suggested that I could use different colors and bold styles to highlight important information in the paragraphs otherwise it is hard to skim through the page. So red color and bold text are applied to some of the key information where I want to draw readers' attention.

### Final Reflection

I learned a lot from this project - not just about the topic I have selected to work on but also about using data visualizations to tell the story in a way that is evidence-based, audience-friendly, and inspiring. I got to apply the principles of data visualization I learned during the classes in practice. It also gave me a chance to be more proficient in using visualization tools including Tableau and Flourish. This was also my first time using Shorthand, which I found is really easy and helpful to create stunning websites quickly. In summary, I enjoyed working on this project!
