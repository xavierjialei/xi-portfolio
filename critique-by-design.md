As China is becoming an increasingly large market for movie releases, entertainment studios are investing heavily in the distribution in China. Using the example of Marvel, the article wants to illustrate that the Chinese market is important and contributes a noticeable proportion to the box office performance of a movie. However, I feel the data visualization "Share of Marvel films' box office sales in China" on the page could be improved for better understanding and easier comparison. One of the biggest problems in the current visualization is that it could be misleading - comparing the percentage shares only without taking the base numbers into consideration can lead to inaccurate conclusions. For example, Captain Marvel is a bigger hit than Ant-Man and the Wasp in the Chinese market (14% of 1.1 billion is larger than 18% of 622.6 million), but the chart fails to present this information properly. 

## Step 2: Critique the data visualization
I went through the critique process of the selected visualization following the Effectiveness Profile method.

- **Usefulness (8):** The usefulness of the data visualization depends on the audience it is targeting. For this chart which shows the percentage share of Marvel’s box office sales in China, I think it is useful for film studios who rely on such data to make decisions on film distribution in China. The data can help answer questions like: Are Marvel films popular in China? How much revenue can a film release in China generate using the example of Marvel? Is the share of the Chinese market increasing or decreasing over the years?
- **Completeness (9):** I think the visualization has all the relevant information to make it understandable. With the presence of basic information including movie titles, years, global sales, and shares from China, there is no missing or confusing information. It is also not overwhelmed with information that can potentially distract readers.
- **Perceptibility (4):** The perceptibility of this visualization can be improved. Although it is indicated under the title that films are shown in order of release year, readers might still be confused by the numbers in the parenthesis next to the titles. In addition, using numbers only to reflect the global sales and separating them from the share from China makes it more different for readers to truly understand the contribution of Chinese box office sales. For instance, Avengers: Age of Ultron is actually generating more sales in China compared to Ant-Man (17% of $1.4 billion is larger than 20% of $519 million), but readers might mistakenly think the opposite because only the part of share percentage is visualized.
- **Truthfulness (6):** Overall the visualization is accurate. However, since almost all the percentages are under 20%, it is hard to differentiate. Also, the absence of visualizing global sales and shares from China together might lead readers to make incorrect conclusions.
- **Intuitiveness (7):** The bar chart is familiar and intuitive for general readers. It is not difficult to understand what the chart is talking about. There is also an instruction on the order of the movies.
- **Aesthetics (7):** The visualization is clean and comfortable to look at. I think the overall layout is clear and easy for readers to navigate. The use of blue is also appropriate as it does not distract the readers and makes the texts easy to read.
- **Engagement (5):** I think the visualization can do a better job in terms of engagement. There is nothing too distracting, but it does not provide any direct insights or inspiration for the readers.

**Overall Observation**

I think this data visualization presents a clear structure without unnecessary information. The title and explanation of order effectively guide readers to interpret the data. The use of bar chart makes it easy to understand and compare. However, the separation of global sales and shares from China into two columns might mislead the readers to make wrongful conclusions. A reader may think Ant-Man and the Wasp is one of the most popular Marvel movies in China as it has a leading share of 19%. But this conclusion is not correct as its actual sales number is in the low range. Therefore, I would probably visualize the global sales as well and incorporate shares from China to make a segmented bar chart for easier and more accurate comparison. I would also put the years into their own column to stress the time information in the chart.


**Primary Audience**

The primary audience of this visualization may be the film studios that are analyzing the performance of the Chinese box office and evaluating their investment in movie distributions in China. Since Marvel is a leading producer of blockbuster movies, this data serves as an indicator of how much the Chinese audience likes this type of movies and how much revenue the Chinese market is contributing to the worldwide box office records over the years. I think the visualization is somehow effective to reach the audience as it provides clear and straightforward information. But the audience might be misled due to the fact the percentage shares do not reflect the actual amount of box office sales in China.


**Evaluating the Method**

This method works well in evaluating the data visualization. It has captured the important criteria that a successful data visualization should focus on. The ratings for each category also help to visualize and enable readers to understand quickly the strongest and weakest aspects of a visualization. Compared to the Good Charts method, I think the Effectiveness Profile method is more structured and provides more guidance. The arrangement chart in the Effectiveness Profile is directly linked with the rationales. It is also easier to understand. Meanwhile, it is somehow difficult to rate design execution and contextual awareness directly in the Good Charts Matrix as they are not broken down or thought through when I am making notes.

In addition to the existing criteria in the Effectiveness Profile, I suggest there could be another category of “interactivity” as we are using digital tools to make visualizations more frequently. Interactivity focuses on whether the reader can interact with the visualization to see more details in a specific aspect, highlight important information, or temporarily hide unwanted information. Interactivity often makes the visualization more fun and memorable as well.


## Step 3: Sketch out a solution
I tried different visualizations using hand-drawn sketches in order to quickly form the ideas in my mind and compare. Note that the scale of data in the sketches are not accurate as they are only meant to convey the idea of layout and format.

## Step 4: Test the solution

I interviewed two friends of mine for their opinions on the sketch of the redesigned visualization.

###### Student, mid 20’s
> Can you tell me what you think this is?

> It’s a bar chart showing the box office records of Marvel movies.

> Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

> Marketing managers in Marvel Studios who want to analyze their box office sales in China.

> Can you see what is being emphasized here?

> Maybe the shares from the Chinese market.

> What else do you notice that is important in the chart?

> Maybe the years. This can show the trend of growth over the past few years. But the sales performance also depends on the quality of the movies.

> Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

> It would be better if I could see the unit and numbers in the chart. Currently I can only see a rough difference in the length of the bars, but I don’t know the exact sales numbers.

> Is there anything you think can be improved?

> I suggest that the years can be sorted in descending order, starting from the most recent. Since the data from the recent year is more important, I would make it easier for the readers to find. 


###### Accountant, mid 20’s
> Can you tell me what you think this is?

> A bar chart comparing the box office sales in China and the rest of the world.

> Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

> Film studios who intend to distribute their movies in China and want to decide if they should increase their investment in the Chinese market.

> Can you see what is being emphasized here?

> The shares from China of each movie.

> What else do you notice that is important in the chart?

> Marvel’s global box office is increasing over the years, and the shares from China are also increasing.

> Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

> Do the shaded parts refer to the shares from China or global sales? There is no legend to explain this relationship.

> Is there anything you think can be improved?

> I would add a conclusive sentence under the title so that readers can quickly understand what I’m trying to express without diving into the bar chart. Color should also be used for better engagement. 


From the interviews, I noticed some aspects of my sketch that work well:
- The bar chart makes comparison easy.
- The segmented bars show the sales information in a relatively more accurate fashion.
- Readers are able to interpret the message that the chart is trying to present properly.
- The title helps readers understand the chart effectively.


I also noticed some aspects that do not work well and can be improved:
- Add unit information for the sales numbers.
- Add a legend to explain which parts of the bars represent which information.
- Use colors for better engagement.
- Add some conclusive or summary sentences for easier understanding.


Based on the interview feedback, I built the first version of my redesign in Flourish (note that I used separated bars instead of segmented bars because I could not figure out a way to combine sales number from China and global sales numbers into one segmented bar):
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11217495"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>



I presented this version of the redeign to my classmates, and I received a few insightful feedack as well:
- Separated bars make the chart too long. Should still use stacked bars. Could divide the bars into sales from China and sales from the rest of the world.
- The dark and light blue colors work particularly well.
- The "million US dollars" unit is repetitive.
- Add a label to the x axis.
- Move the intervals of the x-axis to the top of the chart so that it is easier to read. Readers don't have to scroll down to the bottom to see what the x axis is.
- The title and summary sentences are still missing.
-
