# Critique by Design

## Step 1: Find a data visualization

Visualization in the link: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/02/shang-chi-doesnt-have-a-release-date-in-china-why-thats-a-big-deal.html

As China is becoming an increasinly large market for movie release, entertainment studios are investing heavily in the distribution in China. Using the example of Marvel, the article wants to illustrate that the Chinese market is important and contributes a noticeable proportion to the box office performance of a movie. However, I feel the data visulization "Share of Marvel films' box office sales in China" on the page could be improved for better understanding and easier comparison.

## Step 2: Critique the data visualization
I went through the critique process of the selected visualization following the Effectiveness Profile method.

- Usefulness: 8
The usefulness of the data visualization depends on the audience it is targeting. For this chart which shows the percentage share of Marvelâ€™s box office sales in China, I think it is useful for film studios who rely on such data to make decisions on film distribution in China. The data can help answer questions like: Are Marvel films popular in China? How much revenue can a film release in China generate using the example of Marvel? Is the share of the Chinese market increasing or decreasing over the years?
