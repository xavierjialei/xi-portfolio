This is the portfolio for the class "Telling Stories with Data".


# About Me
My name is Xavier (he/him). I'm currently a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University, studying products and services design with a background in business and computer science. I have three-year professional experience in digital product management of ASR and NLP SaaS solutions. I'm passionate about creating powerful tools and experiences for workflow optimization.


# What I hope to learn
I'm hoping to learn more about the best practices in data visualization and storytelling from this class. As a product manager, I work with data a lot and is often required to present insights from data to various stakeholders on the team. The capability to tell good stories with data will make the insights more convicing and understandable. Such skill also helps me make data-driven decisions when I'm working on product roadmapping and feature prioritization. Therefore, I believe this course can benefit my professional development by enabling me to create better products with the power of data.
