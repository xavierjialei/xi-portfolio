This is the portfolio that includes all the assignments and the final project for the class "Telling Stories with Data" at CMU.


# About Me
My name is Xavier Xi and I go by he/him pronouns. I'm currently a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University, studying products and services design. In 2018, I received my Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration with double majors in Information Systems and Computer Science from the University of Hong Kong. As I was more interested in empathizing with users and collaborating in teams to solve users’ pain points, I decided to pursue a career path in product management. Upon graduation from college, I had the chance to join a startup that develops enterprise SaaS solutions with applications of speech recognition and natural language processing to work as a product manager for almost three years. I'm passionate about creating powerful tools and experiences for workflow optimization.


# What I hope to learn
I'm hoping to learn more about the best practices in data visualization and storytelling from this class. As a product manager, I work with data a lot and is often required to present insights from data to various stakeholders on the team. The capability to tell good stories with data will make the insights more convicing and understandable. Such skill also helps me make data-driven decisions when I'm working on product roadmapping and feature prioritization. Therefore, I believe this course can benefit my professional development by enabling me to create better products with the power of data.
